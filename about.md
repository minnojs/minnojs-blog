[MinnoJS](https://minnojs.github.io/) is a free tool for creating web studies with sophisticated questionnaires
and reaction time tasks. This blog is all about programming with Minno.
We are a group of programmers and researchers that participated in the creation of MinnoJS.
This is where we write about the problems that we solve and the chalenges that we face.

So you're asking why Minno?
First of all, Minno is fun.
Minno scripts are easy to read and write even without previous knowledge in programming.

Second, it's flexible.
It is predesigned to be rich and flexible.
But because of its close association with Javascript 
(one of the most popular programming languages in the world *and* the programming language of the web),
it is very easy to do practically anything that you want.

Finally, it is steady and well proven.
Minno has been developed by [Project Implicit](http://projectimplicit.net/about.html) for
running social cognitive experiments online.
On Project Implicit's [website](http://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit), studies developed with Minno.js
collect data from thousands of participants every day.
